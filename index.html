      <h2 style="margin-top: 20px; color: #e0e0e0;">About me:</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME-USP), where students have the freedom to choose specific paths within the field (<a href="https://bcc.ime.usp.br/trilhas/" target="_blank" style="color: #4fa4ff;">https://bcc.ime.usp.br/trilhas/</a>), and even combine them if they wish.<br>

        After taking the course MAC0102 — designed to help students explore and choose one or more of these specialization tracks — I decided to fully pursue the Software and Artificial Intelligence tracks.
        The Software track appealed to me because it provides a comprehensive understanding of how programming evolves into real-world applications. It covers not only the development process but also the broader context of software as a product: design, deployment, user experience, and project lifecycle.<br>
        The AI track, on the other hand, reflects the current and future landscape of technology. With artificial intelligence becoming increasingly integrated into everyday tools and services, having a solid grasp of AI concepts is essential. Moreover, combining AI with Software opens the door to developing intelligent and user-friendly applications — a synergy that strongly motivates me.<br>
        
        Finally, it's worth noting that my choice of these tracks doesn't prevent me from exploring other fields, such as Data Science and Theoretical Computer Science, which I also find fascinating.
